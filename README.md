## Introduction

> [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a word guessing game created by Josh Wardle that was acquired by The New York Times in January 2022.

In our version of the game, players have 5 tries to guess a randomly selected 4-letter word from our bank of 1,950+ words. We also introduce **Oka Mode** a game mode that prevents players from viewing their previous guesses, making it harder for the player to see what letters have already been limited.

## Game Play
**Aim:**
Guess the correct word in 5 turns. 

 - At any point, you may backtrack to see previous guesses and their results (except if in Oka Mode).
 - After submitting each guess, the game machine will colour the letters as green, yellow or white.
 - You may clear your input using the clear button.
 - At any point, you may exit the current round and reset to a random letter using the reset button.
 - Click the Oka Button to activate Oka Mode. You can only exit Oka Mode if you give up and press RESET. 

The colour grading for each letter guess is as follows:
 - Green - Correct Letter & Correct Position 
 - Yellow - Correct Letter & Wrong Position
 - White - Wrong Letter

## Implementation
We implemented this game using this data path.
