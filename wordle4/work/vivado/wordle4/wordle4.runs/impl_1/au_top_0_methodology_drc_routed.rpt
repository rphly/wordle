There is a large setup violation of -42.421 ns between keyboard_controller/m_/button_cond/M_ctr_q_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_0) and betaCPU/r/M_temp_coloured_letter_q_reg[0]/CE (clocked by clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
